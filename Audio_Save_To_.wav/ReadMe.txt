Description:
Get audio data from the INMP441 microphone module and send them via serial to store the audio data in a wav file.

Upload the arduino code and then run the python script.

Important:
The serial data sending rate and data gathering rate from the microphone is different. So the duration of the recorded time is low in the .wav file.
